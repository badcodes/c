     _L_e_s_s_k_e_y is used to specify a set of key bindings to be  used
     by  _l_e_s_s.  The input file is a text file which describes the
     key bindings, and the output file is a binary file which  is
     used  by _l_e_s_s. If no input file is specified, standard input
     is used.  If no output file  is  specified,  $HOME/_less  is
     used.

     The input file consists of lines of the form:

          string <whitespace> action [extra-string] <newline>

     Whitespace is any sequence of  one  or  more  spaces  and/or
     tabs.   The  "string" is the command key(s) which invoke the
     action.  The string may  be  a  single  command  key,  or  a
     sequence  of up to 15 keys.  The "action" is the name of the
     less action, from the list below.   The  characters  in  the
     "string"  may appear literally, or be prefixed by a carat to
     indicate a control key.  A backslash may be  used  to  cause
     the  following  character to be taken literally.  Characters
     which must be preceded by backslash  include  carat,  space,
     tab  and  the backslash itself.  A backslash followed by one
     to three octal digits may be used to specify a character  by
     its  octal  value.  Blank lines and lines which start with a
     pound sign (#) are ignored.

     An action may be followed by an extra string.   This  string
     is  parsed  after the command is entered, just as if it were
     entered on the command line.  This feature can  be  used  in
     certain cases to extend the functionality of a command.  For
     example, these entries would create a pair  of  commands  to
     turn on/off line numbers using _v_i syntax:

          :set\ nu  toggle-option -N
          :set\ nonu toggle-option +N

     See also the ":ta" command in the example below.

     Commands specified  by  _l_e_s_s_k_e_y  take  precedence  over  the
     default  commands.  A default command key may be disabled by
     including it in the key file with the action "invalid".

     "Extended" keycodes on PCs are entered with a leading \80 instead of \00
